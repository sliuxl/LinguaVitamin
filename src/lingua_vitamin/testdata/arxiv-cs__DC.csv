0,From Connectivity to Autonomy: The Dawn of Self-Evolving Communication   Systems,"This paper envisions 6G as a self-evolving telecom ecosystem, where AI-driven intelligence enables dynamic adaptation beyond static connectivity. We explore the key enablers of autonomous communication systems, spanning reconfigurable infrastructure, adaptive middleware, and intelligent network functions, alongside multi-agent collaboration for distributed decision-making. We explore how these methodologies align with emerging industrial IoT frameworks, ensuring seamless integration within digital manufacturing processes. Our findings emphasize the potential for improved real-time decision-making, optimizing efficiency, and reducing latency in networked control systems. The discussion addresses ethical challenges, research directions, and standardization efforts, concluding with a technology stack roadmap to guide future developments. By leveraging state-of-the-art 6G network management techniques, this research contributes to the next generation of intelligent automation solutions, bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world industrial applications.",2025-05-29T17:45:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23710v1,"Zeinab Nezami, Syed Danial Ali Shah, Maryam Hafeez, Karim Djemame, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi",$GERMAN,$CHINESE_TRANSLATION
